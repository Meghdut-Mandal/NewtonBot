## Documentation

This bot currently supports Whatsapp Multi Device. And is a Migration from the legacy [Whataspp Web Bot](https://github.com/BotsAppOfficial/BotsApp).

### Using Docker locally

To follow this method, you will need to have docker installed on your machine and have some experience using docker.

To host the bot on your own device using docker, follow the following steps on your terminal / command prompt -

```bash
git clone https://github.com/Meghdut-Mandal/NewtonBot.git
cd NewtonBot
docker build -t botsapp .
docker run -d -â€“restart=always --name botsapp botsapp
```

This will create a container running NewtonBot. You'll have to scan the QR at least once.

### The GNU/Linux Legacy Way

To use this method, you will need ffmpeg, nodejs, npm installed on your device.

To run the bot on your device manually, you can use the following commands -

```bash
git clone https://github.com/Meghdut-Mandal/NewtonBot.git
cd NewtonBot
yarn install
yarn start
## scan the QR code
```
